\n\nconst rest = new REST({ version: '9' }).setToken('token');\n\n(async () => {\n  try {\n    console.log('Started refreshing application (/) commands.');\n\n    await rest.put(\n      Routes.applicationGuildCommands(CLIENT_ID, GUILD_ID),\n      { body: commands },\n    );\n\n    console.log('Successfully reloaded application (/) commands.');\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n  }\n})();\n```\n\nAfterwards we can create a quite simple example bot:\n```js\nconst { Client, Intents } = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS] });\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n});\n\nclient.on('interactionCreate', async interaction => {\n  if (!interaction.isCommand()) return;\n\n  if (interaction.commandName === 'ping') {\n    await interaction.reply('Pong!');\n  }\n});\n\nclient.login('token');\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [Website](https://discord.js.org/) ([source](https://github.com/discordjs/website))\n- [Documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs)\n- [Guide](https://discordjs.guide/) ([source](https://github.com/discordjs/guide))\n  See also the [Update Guide](https://discordjs.guide/additional-info/changes-in-v13.html), including updated and removed items in the library.\n- [discord.js Discord server](https://discord.gg/djs)\n- [Discord API Discord server](https://discord.gg/discord-api)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)\n- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)\n- [Related libraries](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/community-resources#libraries)\n\n### Extensions\n\n- [RPC](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-rpc) ([source](https://github.com/discordjs/RPC))\n\n## Contributing\n\nBefore creating an issue, please ensure that it hasn't already been reported/suggested, and double-check the\n[documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs).  \nSee [the contribution guide](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to submit a PR.\n\n## Help\n\nIf you don't understand something in the documentation, you are experiencing problems, or you just need a gentle\nnudge in the right direction, please don't hesitate to join our official [discord.js Server](https://discord.gg/djs).\n": "<div align=\"center\">\n  <br />\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://discord.js.org\"><img src=\"https://discord.js.org/static/logo.svg\" width=\"546\" alt=\"discord.js\" /></a>\n  </p>\n  <br />\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://discord.gg/djs\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/222078108977594368?color=5865F2&logo=discord&logoColor=white\" alt=\"Discord server\" /></a>\n    <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/discord.js.svg?maxAge=3600\" alt=\"npm version\" /></a>\n    <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/discord.js.svg?maxAge=3600\" alt=\"npm downloads\" /></a>\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/actions\"><img src=\"https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/workflows/Testing/badge.svg\" alt=\"Tests status\" /></a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n## About\n\ndiscord.js is a powerful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily interact with the\n[Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).\n\n- Object-oriented\n- Predictable abstractions\n- Performant\n- 100% coverage of the Discord API\n\n## Installation\n\n**Node.js 16.6.0 or newer is required.**  \n\n```sh-session\nnpm install discord.js\nyarn add discord.js\npnpm add discord.js\n```\n\n### Optional packages\n\n- [zlib-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zlib-sync) for WebSocket data compression and inflation (`npm install zlib-sync`)\n- [erlpack](https://github.com/discord/erlpack) for significantly faster WebSocket data (de)serialisation (`npm install discord/erlpack`)\n- [bufferutil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bufferutil) for a much faster WebSocket connection (`npm install bufferutil`)\n- [utf-8-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/utf-8-validate) in combination with `bufferutil` for much faster WebSocket processing (`npm install utf-8-validate`)\n- [@discordjs/voice](https://github.com/discordjs/voice) for interacting with the Discord Voice API (`npm install @discordjs/voice`)\n\n## Example usage\n\nInstall all required dependencies:\n```sh-session\nnpm install discord.js @discordjs/rest discord-api-types\nyarn add discord.js @discordjs/rest discord-api-types\npnpm add discord.js @discordjs/rest discord-api-types\n```\n\nRegister a slash command against the Discord API:\n```js\nconst { REST } = require('@discordjs/rest');\nconst { Routes } = require('discord-api-types/v9');\n\nconst commands = [{\n  name: 'ping',\n  description: 'Replies with Pong!'\n}];
