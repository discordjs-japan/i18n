  "# Version 10\nVersion 10's non-BC changes focus on cleaning up some inconsistencies that exist in previous versions.\nUpgrading from v9 should be quick and painless.\n\n## Client options\nAll client options have been converted to camelCase rather than snake_case, and `max_message_cache` was renamed to `messageCacheMaxSize`.\n\nv9 code example:\n```js\nconst client = new Discord.Client({\n  disable_everyone: true,\n  max_message_cache: 500,\n  message_cache_lifetime: 120,\n  message_sweep_interval: 60\n});\n```\n\nv10 code example:\n```js\nconst client = new Discord.Client({\n  disableEveryone: true,\n  messageCacheMaxSize: 500,\n  messageCacheLifetime: 120,\n  messageSweepInterval: 60\n});\n```\n\n## Presences\nPresences have been completely restructured.\nPrevious versions of discord.js assumed that users had the same presence amongst all guilds - with the introduction of sharding, however, this is no longer the case.\n\nv9 discord.js code may look something like this:\n```js\nUser.status; // the status of the user\nUser.game; // the game that the user is playing\nClientUser.setStatus(status, game, url); // set the new status for the user\n```\n\nv10 moves presences to GuildMember instances. For the sake of simplicity, though, User classes also expose presences.\nWhen accessing a presence on a User object, it simply finds the first GuildMember for the user, and uses its presence.\nAdditionally, the introduction of the Presence class keeps all of the presence data organised.\n\n**It is strongly recommended that you use a GuildMember's presence where available, rather than a User.\nA user may have an entirely different presence between two different guilds.**\n\nv10 code:\n```js\nMemberOrUser.presence.status; // the status of the member or user\nMemberOrUser.presence.game; // the game that the member or user is playing\nClientUser.setStatus(status); // online, idle, dnd, offline\nClientUser.setGame(game, streamingURL); // a game\nClientUser.setPresence(fullPresence); // status and game combined\n```\n\n## Voice\nVoice has been rewritten internally, but in a backwards-compatible manner.\nThere is only one breaking change here; the `disconnected` event was renamed to `disconnect`.\nSeveral more events have been made available to a VoiceConnection, so see the documentation.\n\n## Events\nMany events have been renamed or had their arguments change.\n\n### Client events\n|    Version   9                                       |    Version   10                               |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|    guildMemberAdd(guild, member)                     |    guildMemberAdd(member)                     |\n|    guildMemberAvailable(guild, member)               |    guildMemberAvailable(member)               |\n|    guildMemberRemove(guild, member)                  |    guildMemberRemove(member)                  |\n|    guildMembersChunk(guild, members)                 |    guildMembersChunk(members)                 |\n|    guildMemberUpdate(guild, oldMember, newMember)    |    guildMemberUpdate(oldMember, newMember)    |\n|    guildRoleCreate(guild, role)                      |    roleCreate(role)                           |\n|    guildRoleDelete(guild, role)                      |    roleDelete(role)                           |\n|    guildRoleUpdate(guild, oldRole, newRole)          |    roleUpdate(oldRole, newRole)               |\n\nThe guild parameter that has been dropped from the guild-related events can still be derived using `member.guild` or `role.guild`.\n\n### VoiceConnection events\n| Version 9    | Version 10 |\n|--------------|------------|\n| disconnected | disconnect |\n\n## Dates and timestamps\nAll dates/timestamps on the structures have been refactored to have a consistent naming scheme and availability.\nAll of them are named similarly to this:  \n**Date:** `Message.createdAt`  \n**Timestamp:** `Message.createdTimestamp`  \nSee the docs for each structure to see which date/timestamps are available on them.\n\n\n# Version 9\nThe version 9 (v9) rewrite takes a much more object-oriented approach than previous versions,\nwhich allows your code to be much more readable and manageable.\nIt's been rebuilt from the ground up and should be much more stable, fixing caching issues that affected\nolder versions. It also has support for newer Discord Features, such as emojis.\n\nVersion 9, while containing a sizable number of breaking changes, does not require much change in your code's logic -\nmost of the concepts are still the same, but loads of functions have been moved around.\nThe vast majority of methods you're used to using have been moved out of the Client class,\ninto other more relevant classes where they belong.\nBecause of this, you will need to convert most of your calls over to the new methods.\n\nHere are a few examples of methods that have changed:\n* `Client.sendMessage(channel, message)` ==> `TextChannel.sendMessage(message)`\n  * `Client.sendMessage(user, message)` ==> `User.sendMessage(message)`\n* `Client.updateMessage(message, \"New content\")` ==> `Message.edit(\"New Content\")`\n* `Client.getChannelLogs(channel, limit)` ==> `TextChannel.fetchMessages({options})`\n* `Server.detailsOfUser(User)` ==> `Server.members.get(User).properties` (retrieving a member gives a GuildMember object)\n* `Client.joinVoiceChannel(voicechannel)` => `VoiceChannel.join()`\n\nA couple more important details:\n* `Client.loginWithToken(\"token\")` ==> `client.login(\"token\")`\n* `Client.servers.length` ==> `client.guilds.size` (all instances of `server` are now `guild`)\n\n## No more callbacks!\nVersion 9 eschews callbacks in favour of Promises. This means all code relying on callbacks must be changed.  \nFor example, the following code:\n\n```js\nclient.getChannelLogs(channel, 100, function(messages) {\n  console.log(`${messages.length} messages found`);\n});\n```\n\n```js\nchannel.fetchMessages({limit: 100}).then(messages => {\n  console.log(`${messages.size} messages found`);\n});\n```\n": "# Version 10\nVersion 10's non-BC changes focus on cleaning up some inconsistencies that exist in previous versions.\nUpgrading from v9 should be quick and painless.\n\n## Client options\nAll client options have been converted to camelCase rather than snake_case, and `max_message_cache` was renamed to `messageCacheMaxSize`.\n\nv9 code example:\n```js\nconst client = new Discord.Client({\n  disable_everyone: true,\n  max_message_cache: 500,\n  message_cache_lifetime: 120,\n  message_sweep_interval: 60\n});\n```\n\nv10 code example:\n```js\nconst client = new Discord.Client({\n  disableEveryone: true,\n  messageCacheMaxSize: 500,\n  messageCacheLifetime: 120,\n  messageSweepInterval: 60\n});\n```\n\n## Presences\nPresences have been completely restructured.\nPrevious versions of discord.js assumed that users had the same presence amongst all guilds - with the introduction of sharding, however, this is no longer the case.\n\nv9 discord.js code may look something like this:\n```js\nUser.status; // the status of the user\nUser.game; // the game that the user is playing\nClientUser.setStatus(status, game, url); // set the new status for the user\n```\n\nv10 moves presences to GuildMember instances.
